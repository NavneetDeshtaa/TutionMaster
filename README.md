The problem TutionMaster solves:

”Unlocking Educational Potential: Say goodbye to the struggle of finding the perfect mentor. Our platform seamlessly
connects passionate mentors with eager students, transcending geographical boundaries and making quality education
accessible to all.”


CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO: 

  1) Geographical Barriers”: Overcoming the challenge of connecting mentors and students,regardless of their location, through a user-friendly online platform.
  
”User Experience”: Crafting a seamless and in-tuitive user experience for both mentors and students, simplifying the process of mentor selection and communication.

Utilizing a modern tech stack, I employed a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML,CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, to architect a robust and scalable web application.
